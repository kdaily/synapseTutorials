## Introduction

RMarkdown files that can rendered directly to Synapse. In general, code (RMarkdown files included) are best kept in a version controlled repository (like Github). If they generate other content (e.g., filter a file, or create a standalone figure) we want to make sure that the provenance is generated correctly, and reflects the most recent commited version. This tutorial describes how we can do this using the `synapseClient` and the `rGithubClient`.
